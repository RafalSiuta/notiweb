                <p>Depending on the User's specific device, this Application may request certain permissions that allow it to access the
                    User's device Data as described below.
                    By default, these permissions must be granted by the User before the respective information can be accessed. Once
                    the
                    permission has been given, it can be revoked by the User at any time. In order to revoke these permissions, Users
                    may
                    refer to the device settings.
                    The exact procedure for controlling app permissions may be dependent on the User's device and software.
                    Please note that the revoking of such permissions might impact the proper functioning of this Application.
                    If User grants any of the permissions listed below, the respective Personal Data may be processed (i.e accessed to,
                    modified or removed) by Noti</p>

                <h3>Controls for DO-NOT-TRACK features</h3>
                <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or
                setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities
                monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has
                been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically
                communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in
                the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
